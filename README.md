# Customer Service AI Project

Welcome to my Customer Service AI project. This is a Jupyter Notebook (`customerService.ipynb`) where I explored different machine learning and AI models to handle customer service tasks. It's not super professional—it’s a learning project, so feel free to dive in and try it out!

## What’s Inside

- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares and processes the data to get it ready for the models.
- **Model Training with Multiple Approaches**:
  - Logistic Regression with TF-IDF
  - Random Forest
  - BERT
  - SBERT
  
  I wanted to compare these models to see which one works best for handling customer queries.
- **Evaluation**: Tests the models and compares their performance to determine the most effective approach.
- **Flexible Setup**: You can easily adapt this to your own dataset or use case.

## What You’ll Need

- **Python** (3.8 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- A few Python libraries

## How to Run It

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the necessary libraries
3. Open the notebook:
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to clean the data, train the models, and compare their performance.

## File Overview

- `customerService.ipynb`: The main file where all the action happens.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project.

- **Compare Models**: Learn how different models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, BERT, and SBERT perform for the same task.
- **Chatbots**: Use it to build a chatbot that answers customer queries effectively.
- **Improve Services**: Use insights to enhance customer experience.

Feel free to use or modify it as you like.
